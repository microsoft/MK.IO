Examples:         timescale=1, startTimestamp=0, endTimestamp=10: The first 10 seconds of content will be included in the output.         timescale=1, startTimestamp=10, endTimestamp=70: The 60 seconds of content starting at 10 seconds will be included in the output.         timescale=10000000, startTimestamp=0, endTimestamp=100000000: The first 10 seconds of content will be included in the output.          In cases where the endTimestamp does not perfectly align with a segment boundary, the endTimestamp will be rounded down to the nearest segment boundary.
